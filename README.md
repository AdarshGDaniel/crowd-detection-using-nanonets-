# crowd-detection-using-nanonets-
This program uses nanonets api to detect the crowd in the given picture. 

This program can be used to teach people how AI or machine learning works. This program uses nanonets API and their servers to detect and train model.
We used matplotlib for drawing the plots. 

There are Few steps you should do before you run the program

First : make sure you are inside the crowd detection directory 

second : run the following commands to export the IDs

*export NANONETS_API_KEY=Wzqi3cwoOBXP_T5KKaHoCavBmw6tvwWb*
*export NANONETS_MODEL_ID=eedd33cf-b149-4f22-989e-fd55f3a8993a*
    

third : run the program along with the path to the code and the image you want to detect of.

example:
*python3 ./code/prediction.py ./images/88.jpg*


Hopefully this works!!

Happy coding!
